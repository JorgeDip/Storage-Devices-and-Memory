### Floppy Disks (Legacy Storage Media)

![](https://www.silicon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/floppy-disks-1280x720.jpg)

Before USB drives and modern hard drives, **floppy disks** were the primary form of removable data storage for personal computers.  
They allowed users to **transfer small files**, **boot operating systems**, and **store documents** in the 1980s and 1990s.  
Although they’re now obsolete, floppy disks are still used in some **vintage computers**, **industrial machines**, and by **collectors**.

---

#### 🧠 General Overview

- **Type:** Magnetic storage (removable disk)
- **Form factors:** 8″ → 5¼″ → 3½″ (most common)
- **Data written:** Magnetically on a flexible disk inside a plastic shell
- **Interface:** Originally via floppy disk controllers (FDD), later via USB floppy drives

#### Capacity and Formats

| Format | Size (inches) | Typical Capacity                                | Common Use Period      | Notes                                                          |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 8″     | 8 inches      | 80 KB – 1.2 MB                                  | 1970s–early 1980s      | First generation, used in mainframes and minicomputers         |
| 5¼″    | 5.25 inches   | 360 KB (DD) – 1.2 MB (HD)                       | 1980s                  | Used in early IBM PCs and Apple II systems                     |
| 3½″    | 3.5 inches    | 720 KB (DD) – 1.44 MB (HD) – 2.88 MB (ED, rare) | Late 1980s–early 2000s | Most common floppy type; hard plastic shell with metal shutter |

#### ⚙️ Fun Facts

- The term **“Save” icon** 💾 in most software still represents a floppy disk.
- A single HD floppy (1.44 MB) can store about **1,000 text pages** — far less than a single modern photo.
- Early Windows 95 installations required **up to 13 floppy disks**.
- Floppies are still symbolically used in retro and tech art.

## 2.0 Optical

Optical storage devices are data storage media that use laser technology to read and write information. They are commonly used to store music, movies, software, and backup files. Data is recorded on the surface of a disc and can be accessed using an optical drive. These devices became very popular due to their large storage capacity, portability, and durability.

### 2.1 Main Optical Storage Devices

1. **CD (Compact Disc)**  
   ![CD/Verbatim](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81DeNpYwYrL.jpg)
   The CD was one of the first popular optical storage devices. It can store around **700 MB** of data and is widely used for **music and software distribution**.

2. **DVD (Digital Versatile Disc)**
   ![DVD/Verbatim](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Oze+jqVKL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg)
   DVDs offer higher capacity than CDs (up to **4.7 GB per disc**) and are mainly used for **movies, video games, and data storage**.

3. **Blu-ray Disc**
   ![Blue-ray/Verbatim](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-Ow77KlrL.jpg)  
   Blu-ray discs provide even greater storage capacity (**25 GB or more**) and are used for **high-definition video and large data backups**.

#### Summary

| DVD     | Digital Versatile Disc | 4.7 GB           | Movies, games         |
| Blu-ray | Blu-ray Disc           | 25 GB or more    | HD video, data backup |

## 3.0 Flash Memory

Flash memory is a type of **non-volatile storage** that retains data even when the power is turned off.  
It uses electronic cells to store information, making it faster and more durable than traditional magnetic or optical storage.  
Flash memory is widely used in modern devices like smartphones, cameras, and USB drives.

### 3.1 Types of Flash Memory

1. **USB Flash Drive**

#### Summary Table

| Device          | Full Name                  | Volatile | Typical Capacity | Common Use                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| USB Flash Drive | Universal Serial Bus Drive | No       | 4 GB – 1 TB      | File transfer, backups     |
| SD Card         | Secure Digital Card        | No       | 2 GB – 2 TB      | Cameras, laptops, consoles |

#### Additional Notes

- Flash memory has **no moving parts**, which makes it **shock-resistant** and **energy-efficient**.
- It provides **faster read/write speeds** than optical devices.
- However, flash memory has a **limited number of write cycles**, meaning it can wear out after many rewrites.

## 4.0 Memory

Computer memory refers to the electronic components that store data and instructions for processing.  
It allows the CPU to access information quickly, making it one of the most important parts of a computer’s performance.  
There are different types of memory, each with its own purpose and speed.

### 4.1 Types of Memory

1. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**
   ![RAM/ellxir](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41t3rzh4ilL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg)  
    This product have 8 GB of memory [link to purchase](https://www.amazon.es/Memoria-aplicaci%C3%B3n-escritorio-productos-gen%C3%A9rica/dp/B0876W3DR5)

   RAM is the main memory used by the computer to store data temporarily while programs are running.  
    It is **volatile**, meaning all information is lost when the computer is turned off.  
    More RAM allows the system to handle more tasks at the same time.

   **Examples:** DDR3, DDR4, DDR5

2. **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**  
   ![ROM](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTWevpZDoRS8sMjcqJTv1G0NNXEYkIabpzM3OAL9iesqOLy-bes7-dlRQIx_O46Xw31Rpc&usqp=CAU)

   ROM is **non-volatile** memory that permanently stores instructions needed to start the computer (the BIOS or firmware).  
    The data in ROM cannot be easily modified or deleted.  
    It ensures the computer can boot even when no other storage is available.

3. **Cache Memory**
   ![Cache](https://hardzone.es/app/uploads-hardzone.es/2020/01/Memoria-cache-e1578411455693.jpg)
   Cache is a very fast and small type of memory located close to the CPU.  
    It stores copies of frequently used data to reduce access time and improve processing speed.  
    There are usually several levels: **L1**, **L2**, and **L3**, with L1 being the fastest and smallest.

#### Summary Table

| Type  | Full Name            | Volatile | Function                                            | Example    |
| ----- | -------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| RAM   | Random Access Memory | Yes      | Temporary data storage while running programs       | DDR4, DDR5 |
| ROM   | Read-Only Memory     | No       | Permanent storage for system startup instructions   | BIOS       |
| Cache | Cache Memory         | Yes      | Very fast memory close to CPU for quick data access | L1, L2, L3 |

---

#### Additional Notes

- **Volatile memory** loses its data when the power is off.
- **Non-volatile memory** keeps data even without power.
- The combination of **RAM, ROM, and cache** ensures a balance between speed, reliability, and long-term storage.

### Memory Hierarchy Pyramid

![Memory hierarchy pyramid](images/memory_pyramid.png "Memory hierarchy pyramid")

**Labels (top → bottom):**

![pyramid](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319529366/figure/fig1/AS:535981658828805@1504799393590/The-memory-hierarchy-pyramid.png)

The **Memory Hierarchy** represents how computer storage is organized based on **speed**, **cost**, and **capacity**.  
It shows the relationship between different types of memory — from the fastest and smallest to the slowest and largest.

As we move **down** the pyramid:

- Access time **increases**
- Cost per bit **decreases**
- Storage capacity **increases**

As we move **up** the pyramid:

- Access time **decreases**
- Cost per bit **increases**
- Storage capacity **decreases**
